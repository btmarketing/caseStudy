#BitTorrent Case Study

Interactive Case Study framework, using HTML5 features (canvas,css transitions/animations/filters,svg)

Look inside main.js to find the most important controlling variables (like unitSize, gutter, xDim/yDim)

Also, coordinates.js has comments explaining the grid system, and how to update the boxes and layouts to suite your needs.

checkers.js and contentBox.js hold the two main classes, and shouldn't need changing during updates and small edits

All graph code is inside js/graphCode, and their functions are triggered when their visible to the user (using calls to offsetWidth with setInterval)
